              <h1 class="fs-3 fw-normal mt-6">Terms & Conditions</h1>
              <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Boyan Yi.
                Boyan Yi is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
                
                <p>The <strong>Dream Photo</strong> app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Dream Photo app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
                
                <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
                
                <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app</p>
                
                <p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></p>
                
                <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Boyan Yi will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Boyan Yi cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
                
                <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. </p>
                
                <p>In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
                
                <p>Along the same lines, Boyan Yi cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Boyan Yi cannot accept responsibility.</p>
                
                <p>With respect to Boyan Yi’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Boyan Yi accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
                
                <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Boyan Yi does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

              <p>This Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy ("Policy") applies to the "Dream Photo mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related products and services (collectively, "Services") and outlines how this Mobile Application developer ("Application Provider", "we", "us" or "our") addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you ("you" or "your") may submit a copyright infringement complaint.</p>

              <p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>
              
              <p>Copyright is a legal right that protects the original works of authors (e.g., music, videos, etc.). All the contents available in the "Dream Photo" app are copyright protected and owned by Dream Photo and its licensors. We solely preserve the right of the contents and their handling with respect to the app. For the users of the app, we hereby grant a license that is non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable in nature so that users are able to view and use the contents of the app.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Copyright Infringement</strong></p>
              
              <p>We strive to protect proprietary rights of intellectual properties of all persons and entities and are always cautious against any kind of copyright infringement. However, if any content on the "Dream Photo" app is found to be violating anyone&#39;s copyrights, or other types of intellectual property rights then we are willing to remove that content in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Our course of action is determined by DMCA. In order to send a DMCA takedown notice to us, a mail has to be sent at dmsfoto@outlook.com containing details of the complaint.</p>
              
              <p><strong>A. What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</strong></p>
              
              <p>Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.</p>
              
              <p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>
              
              <p>We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with third parties. If you are concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to hire an agent to report infringing material for you.</p>
              
              <p><strong>B. Notifications of infringement</strong></p>
              
              <p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent there of, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a copyright infringement mail ("Notification") using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a DMCA takedown notice generator or other similar services to avoid making mistakes and ensure compliance with your Notification. Failure to include necessary information may limit our ability to investigate your claims and may result in your complaint being denied.</p>
              
              <p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to the allegedly infringing material.</p>
              
              <p>If we remove or restrict access to materials in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address), along with instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>
              
              <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Application Provider reserves
              the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p>
              
              <p><strong>C. Counter-notifications</strong></p>
              
              <p>A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a counter Notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the US Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it means that the material described in the Notification has been removed from our Services or access to the material has been restricted. Please take the time to read through the Notification, which includes information on the Notification we received. To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide a mail with the DMCA requirements. Please note that if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or misidentification, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a counter-notification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Application Provider reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a counter-notification. If we receive a counter-notification that complies with the terms of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), we may forward it to the person who filed the original Notification.
